# Call Center Management Platform Requirements

This document consolidates the functional requirements that surfaced during
recent discovery sessions. The platform is built on Google Apps Script with
Google Sheets as the primary data store and HTML/JavaScript (with jQuery) for
the client-side experience.

## Core Application Goals

1. Provide a secure, multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) experience that
   supports multiple client organizations ("campaigns") within a single
   deployment.
2. Deliver comprehensive call center management workflows spanning
   authentication, scheduling, performance tracking, coaching, reporting, and
   collaboration.
3. Maintain transparent data sharing between the call center operator and each
   client, while enforcing least-privilege access for agents and optional guest
   users from the client side.

## Authentication & Authorization

- **Strict login policies** ensure that all access is scoped to the specific
  client campaign(s) a user belongs to.
- **Role tiers**:
  - **Executives (CEO/CFO/HR, etc.)** – full access to every module across all
    clients and campaigns.
  - **Managers** – access limited to the campaigns and agents they oversee;
    ability to manage rosters, review metrics, and handle coaching actions.
  - **Agents** – default read-only access to personal schedules, QA scores,
    coaching acknowledgements, and performance dashboards. Additional
    privileges can be granted selectively.
  - **Client guests** – limited visibility, primarily QA and performance
    reporting, with optional elevation to broader access by internal admins.
- **Campaign-aware sessions** guarantee that users cannot act on behalf of
  other clients without explicit authorization.

## Multi-Campaign Management

- Support for multiple concurrent client campaigns, each with isolated datasets
  and configurable access rules.
- Managers can administer their assigned campaigns, including agent rosters,
  schedules, and targeted communications.
- Executive users retain the ability to view cross-campaign analytics for
  organizational oversight.

## Agent Experience

- Personal dashboards featuring:
  - Upcoming schedules and shift assignments.
  - QA performance summaries and detailed score breakdowns.
  - Coaching records and acknowledgement workflows.
  - Recognition components highlighting top performers across attendance,
    adherence, QA scores, and other KPIs.
- Lightweight messaging interface to receive managerial updates, coaching
  notifications, and performance feedback.

## Manager & Executive Experience

- Campaign dashboards consolidating agent metrics, attendance, QA outcomes, and
  coaching statuses.
- Ability to issue coaching items, request acknowledgements, and monitor
  follow-up actions.
- Messaging tools to communicate quick updates regarding agent performance and
  compliance.
- Administrative controls for onboarding users, assigning roles, and managing
  client guest access.

## Collaboration & Reporting

- QA collaboration forms and dashboards to capture audits and quality reviews.
- Attendance and adherence reporting views.
- Executive-level summaries aggregating KPIs across campaigns for strategic
  decision making.
- Chat modules to facilitate targeted discussion threads between managers,
  agents, and executives.

## Extensibility Considerations

- Modular HTML views (e.g., Top Performers, QA dashboards, Coaching lists)
  should remain loosely coupled so new KPIs or workflows can be added without
  disrupting existing modules.
- Google Apps Script services should expose clear CRUD interfaces for users,
  schedules, QA records, and coaching entries to support automation and future
  integrations.

## Next Steps

1. Audit existing Apps Script services to confirm they enforce campaign-aware
   access and role-based permissions as described.
2. Inventory current HTML/JS modules to map each requirement to its UI
   counterpart, identifying gaps.
3. Prioritize implementation of strict login flows, campaign scoping, and role
   management updates before layering additional feature work.
